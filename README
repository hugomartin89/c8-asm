C8-ASM
======

C8-ASM is a Chip8 assembler written in C with help of GNU Flex and GNU Bison.
The assembler will take valid Chip8 assembly statements and generate the
correct machine instructions[1].

[1] For now it generates a string that is printed to the stdout stream. This is
    because it was designed to work with danirod's emulator (using --hex flag).
    You can find danirod's chip8 emulator here: http://www.danirod.es/chip8/
